# What is Astro?

Astro JS is a web framework for building high-performance, content-centric websites. It lets you write UI components using your favorite JavaScript web framework (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) and then render the entire site as static HTML at build time. This way, you can end up with a completely static website that doesn't require any JavaScript to load. Astro also supports a variety of front-end tools, such as Tailwind CSS2, and can be deployed anywhere, even to edge servers. The latest version of Astro is 2.0, and it introduces a new front-end architecture (called Astro Islands) that optimizes your website by making it load 33% faster and JavaScript 90% less.
